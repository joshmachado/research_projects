  To date, my work has focused on radio observations of star forming regions in the Milky Way. My interests include molecular clouds, radio astronomy, and galactic (and extragalactic) star formation.

    <h2>NH<sub>3</sub> Measurements in a Massive Galactic Star Forming Region.</h2>
    <p>
      During my time as an undergrad at UConn, I worked with Dr. Cara Battersby on a project using NH<sub>3</sub> emission to study massive star formation in the Milky Way. Using VLA observations of NH<sub>3</sub> inversion transitions I studied the physical properties of W51, one of the most massive and active star forming regions in our galaxy. I created spatial parameter maps of the region. I continued my work on this projet as an REU student at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory during the summmer of 2019. I worked with Dr. Adam Ginsburg, using NH<sub>3</sub> emission in combination with ALMA 1.3mm continuum data to calculate mass estimates for a catalog of previously identified protostellar cores.
