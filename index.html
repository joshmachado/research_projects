  To date, my work has focused on radio observations of star forming regions in the Milky Way. My interests include molecular clouds, galactic (and extragalactic) star formation, and virtually any application of radio and millimeter astronomy. Some specific projects:

    <h2>NH<sub>3</sub> Measurements in a Massive Galactic Star Forming Region.</h2>
    <h4>Advisors: Cara Battersby (U. Connecticut), Adam Ginsburg (U. Florida)</h4>
    <p>
      During my time as an undergraduate at UConn, I worked with Dr. Cara Battersby on a project using NH<sub>3</sub> emission to study massive star formation in the Milky Way. Ammonia is well known for being an excellent thermometer, making it a very useful tool to probe the temperature structure of star forming regions. Using VLA observations of NH<sub>3</sub> inversion transitions I studied the physical properties of W51, one of the most massive and active star forming regions in our galaxy. From fitted spectra, I created spatial parameter maps of the region. I continued my work on this projet as an REU student at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory during the summmer of 2019. I worked with Dr. Adam Ginsburg using NH<sub>3</sub> emission in combination with ALMA 1.3mm continuum data to calculate mass estimates for a catalog of previously identified protostellar cores. I am continuing my work on this project as finalize my first paper.
